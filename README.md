It's worth noting I didn't get a great grade for this assignment. It would not make a good model to follow. 
The spatial epi module grade was much better!

Notes on Advanced Statistical Methods in Epidemiology

1. What was the incidence rate of post-neonatal rotavirus diarrhoea in this cohort? Did this 
rate vary over time?
2. What were the risk factors for post-neonatal rotavirus diarrhoea in this cohort?
3. Was there any evidence that the incidence of rotavirus diarrhoea was either increased or 
decreased if children had experienced a previous episode?


Question 2 about risk factors for developing rv diarrhoea, should not therefore use total number of episodes per subject, i.e. use first episode data only.
